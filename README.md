# Simon-Game
Project 4

    Press the start button to begin. The game will throw out a pattern you must memorize the pattern then repeat it back when the game asks.

   The game was created by iterating through 2 arrays (players and game). Each index place is verified as the player clicks a new button confirming their able to continue to the next color on the pattern. Once the player chooses the wrong pattern the loop will stop once the index place is not matched instead of the entire array.
